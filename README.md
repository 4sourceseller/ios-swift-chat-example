firechat-swift
==============

FireChat implemented in Swift! This is made to work with Xcode 6 Beta 5. It also works in Xcode 6 Beta 6. 

If you're getting a random compiler error, go to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData 
and delete the directory starting with FireChat-Swift. 
(If that doesn't work for some reason, consider blowing away everything in that folder.) 

If you download the zip (I recommend that you clone the repo instead).

1. Download the zip for [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/katfang/JSQMessagesViewController).
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Rename the JSQMessagesViewController-master folder to JSQMessagesViewController 
4. Drop this folder into the firechat-swift-master and replace the existing JSQMessagesViewController folder.
5. Download the zip for [JSQSystemSoundPlayer](https://github.com/katfang/JSQSystemSoundPlayer).
6. Unzip the folder.
7. Rename the JSQSystemSoundPlayer-master folder to JSQSystemSoundPlayer 
8. Drop this folder into the firechat-swift-master and replace the existing JSQSystemSoundPlayer folder.
